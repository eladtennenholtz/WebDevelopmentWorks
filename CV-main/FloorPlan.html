    <h1>Deep Floor Plan Registration App</h1>
    <p>
      Using state of the art deep learning, we design an end-to-end solution for
      floor plan photo registration. Users are able to upload real photos from
      their house, where a pretrained model matches their corresponding areas in
      a given floor plan. Technologies used: Node.js, React, MongoDB, python.
